The Trophy Room was where awards, trophies, cups, plates, shields, 
statues, and medals were kept in crystal glass displays. This room 
also contained a list of Head Boys and Head Girls. Prominently 
displayed were Hogwarts Awards for Services to the School, with 
known recipients being Tom Marvolo Riddle,[23] Harry Potter and 
Ron Weasley.[47] Probably, in 1995, the Triwizard Cup was placed 
here as well. The Trophy Room was connected to an Armour Gallery.
