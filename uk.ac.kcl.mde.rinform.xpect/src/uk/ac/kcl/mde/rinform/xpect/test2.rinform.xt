The Hogwarts kitchen was located directly under the Great Hall,
down the same staircase that led to the Hufflepuff Common Room. 
It contained tables identical to those in the Great Hall and 
were directly below them; food had to simply be placed on the tables
in the kitchens, and it magically appeared in the Great Hall.
