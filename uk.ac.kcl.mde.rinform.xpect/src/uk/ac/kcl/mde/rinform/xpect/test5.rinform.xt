/* 
The Chamber of Secrets was home to an ancient Basilisk, 
which, according to legend, was intended to be used to 
purge the area of Muggle-born students. The Chamber was 
flanked with towering pillars that were entwined with 
carved wood, and the Statue of Slytherin was at the far end. 
The Basilisk resided within the mouth of Slytherins Statue, 
which possibly symbolised Slytherins ability to speak Parseltongue.
